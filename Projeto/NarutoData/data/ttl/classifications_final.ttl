               :description "Medical-nin (Iryō-nin) are ninja who specialise in medical treatment and use of medical-oriented techniques to heal others. Becoming a medical-nin requires high intelligence and excellent chakra control. A medical-nin is trained to avoid getting injured in any way, for the reason that if they are injured, then there would be nobody to heal the other members of their team. Medical-nin accompany other ninja on high ranking missions to increase the success rate of the mission and overall survival rate of the squad. Medical-nin make use of the Mystical Palm Technique — a technique used to heal comrades and can also be used in surgery. It allows them to make precise incisions and then doubles as a means to heal a wound. For more serious injuries, multiple medical-nin can combine their efforts with techniques such as the Healing Resuscitation Regeneration Technique, which uses a portion of the patient's own body as a medium to help the healing process. The knowledge of a medical-nin can be used for a variety of purposes. Hana Inuzuka is a veterinarian medical-nin that specialises in the treatment of ninken. Chiyo, in the past, used her medicinal knowledge to create deadly poisons. However, her efforts were often counteracted by Tsunade, renowned as the greatest medical-nin in the world. According to Madara Uchiha, the First Hokage, Hashirama Senju, was also able to use medical ninjutsu with such skill that he could heal himself instantly without the need of forming hand seals; Madara concluded that Tsunade, who is heralded as the greatest medical-nin in the world, pales in comparison — something Tsunade initially herself admits — but after seeing her Ninja Art Creation Rebirth — Strength of a Hundred Technique, Madara deemed Tsunade's healing abilities similar to that of her grandfather's." .

               :name "Sensor Type" ;
               :description "A sensor type is a shinobi that is capable of detecting others, typically by sensing their chakra. Anyone can feel the presence of chakra when it is especially powerful or released in large enough quantities. However, only sensor type shinobi have the ability to sense chakra at their own discretion, allowing them to detect it in non-combat situations, as well as tell individuals apart by their unique chakra signatures. Skilled sensor types can sense any chakra within a radius of several dozen kilometres, as well as hone in on a specific chakra signature to perceive its movements in greater detail. It is also possible for them to tell if a person is lying by detecting any fluctuations in their chakra, sense when other nearby sensor types are using their abilities, and determine whether they or other individuals are under the effects of genjutsu. Nagato was able to determine the exact location of the person controlling him through their chakra, despite said person erecting a barrier around themselves. Members of the Yamanaka clan can use a technique to transmit their sensory perception to others. Even for sensor types, detecting chakra is not an automatic process; in order to sense chakra, the shinobi must actively be kneading chakra. They must also change their chakra to \"sensory mode\" (kanchi shiyō), making it possible for them to miss important events if they are preoccupied with an ongoing battle. Since concentration is required, it can be difficult to participate in battle while focusing on sensing. Picking out specific individuals from within especially large crowds can also prove challenging, requiring the aid of an experienced sensor type. As chakra signatures are similar among relatives, sensor types can tell members of different species, populations, and bloodlines apart by the feel of their chakra. For example, Karin was able to tell the chakra signatures of dogs apart from those of humans, while Mū commented that Gaara and his father, Rasa, share similar chakra, and also noticed that chakra signatures from several different villages were gathered together in one place. Likewise, Tobirama Senju could tell that Orochimaru's body was almost entirely made up of his brother's cells, as well as discern that Karin was descended from the Uzumaki clan. Sensor types often search for chakra while forming the Ram hand seal and closing their eyes, though this is not always the case. Tobirama Senju and Minato Namikaze are able to detect the presence and number of nearby enemies by simply touching the ground with their fingers. In Karin's case, she uses a technique called Mind's Eye of the Kagura to sense chakra; it is unknown if other sensor types use specific techniques, but in the anime, the general sensing ability is referred to as the Sensing Technique. The means by which one becomes a sensor type are also unclear. It is known that some shinobi are inherently better at sensing than others, and that some individuals appear to possess sensory abilities prior to receiving any shinobi training. Obito Uchiha is an example of a shinobi who displays sensory abilities in adulthood, despite seemingly not having any as a child. There are a number of methods that can hinder a sensor type's ability to detect individuals. When transmitting chakra signals, the user can prevent their location from being discovered by constantly changing the frequency of their chakra. Karin is able to hide her chakra to avoid being found by other sensor types, though this prevents her from using her own sensing abilities. Members of the Aburame clan can use their insects to create false chakra signals in order to confuse sensor types. Mū is able to render his chakra completely untraceable while invisible, earning him the title of Non-Person due to having neither detectable form nor chakra. Gengetsu Hōzuki and his summon use a wide-range genjutsu that prevents them from being sensed while it is in effect. Black Zetsu is also able to render itself undetectable through unknown means. Aside from those who can sense chakra, there are others who qualify as sensor types due to the nature of their abilities, such as members of the Hyūga clan with their Byakugan. Sensor types have different specialties depending on their village of origin, with Konohagakure shinobi often using ninken for tracking. There are also sensory ninjutsu (kanchi ninjutsu) that can be used by those who lack sensory abilities of their own. Examples include Nagato's Rain Tiger at Will Technique and Gaara's Concealed Sand Picture Cat, which is a contact-type (sesshoku taipu) sensory technique. As stated by Jiraiya, no matter how skilled a sensor is, they still cannot sense attacks and need to physically see an attack in order to counter or dodge it. The only way to enhance one's sensory abilities enough to sense attacks is with Sage Mode." .

They completely erase the person they're searching for by means of their superior assassination techniques and medical skills. They could be seen wearing standard armoured Anbu uniform or, in some instances (such as Haku and Ao), a blue kimono with a striped, turtle-necked undershirt. They may also wear a mask with thin slitted eye-hole and a wavy design in place of the mouth, and their village symbol on the forehead. Their masks have human resemblances, rather than the typical animal resemblance most Anbu masks possess. They kill their target, taking the head as proof, and then completely dispose of the body by using various methods, such as cremation or the summoning of wild carrion crows to devour the corpse. This is done in order to make sure the village secrets which a ninja's body holds — such as chakra types, herbs eaten, ninjutsu, special medicine, and kekkei genkai — will not be revealed to outsiders. Hunter-nin are supposed to destroy the corpse at the very spot the body is lying; it is not to be moved after it is dead, and only the head is taken back to prove that the missing-nin is in fact dead. As a requirement, they must possess a thorough and intimate knowledge of human anatomy. Due to their reputation for utterly and completely obliterating the remains of their targets, they are code-named \"The Undertaker Squad\" (Atarutai). Early in the series, Haku poses as a hunter-nin as a ruse to rescue the supposedly killed Zabuza Momochi. Ao, as a true hunter-nin himself, demonstrated great skill in tracking, as his targets grew nervous enough to lay traps to stop him. In the anime, a squad of hunter-nin led by Tsurugi was sent to hunt down the rogue jinchūriki Utakata. In the anime, the team's background is further expanded, with some of its members (one of whom is seen sporting a mask and a hairstyle identical to Haku's, suggesting they might be typical of the group) being revealed wearing flak jackets and using special techniques, such as wielding water ropes to restrain enemies, which can be electrified in order to harm victims, and creating mist which sucks chakra out of the opponents. Hunter-nin also possess a barrier ninjutsu to protect certain body parts, such as an eye. This technique is of the utmost importance and is so secretive that no one besides members of hunter-nin know how to undo it, not even the Mizukage." .

               :description "Missing-nin (nukenin) are ninja who abandon their village with no intention of returning. Missing-nin are criminals in effect, if not before their defection then certainly after abandoning their duties. As such, missing-nin are listed in their village's Bingo Book to be killed on-sight; Kirigakure's hunter-nin are specifically assigned to eliminate these missing-nin. Although some missing-nin may continue wearing their village's forehead protector, they no longer swear allegiance to their village; members of Akatsuki — most of them missing-nin — carve scratches across their forehead protectors to symbolise they have rejected their village. Leaving the village does not necessarily automatically make one a missing-nin. Tsunade withdraws from life as a ninja and departs from Konoha following the Second Shinobi World War, but she is at no time considered a missing-nin by the village. Jiraiya informs her, however, that if she aids Orochimaru — an enemy of Konoha — that her status will change and he will be forced to kill her. Rōshi left Iwagakure to learn more and to better control of Son Gokū that was sealed inside him, but despite taking such a potential war power from the village, he was not branded a missing-nin either. Likewise, being branded a missing-nin does not guarantee their former village will seek them out as a criminal. Itachi Uchiha becomes a missing-nin after the Uchiha Clan Downfall, but he does so under orders of Konoha's leadership; while most of Konoha's population does indeed consider Itachi a criminal and treats him as such, its leaders are privately aware that he remains loyal to Konoha. Similarly, when Sasuke Uchiha defects from Konoha and becomes a missing-nin, the Fifth Hokage decides not to pursue him as a criminal as a favour to Naruto Uzumaki. Danzō, when appointed the \"Sixth Hokage Candidate\", later withdraws this leniency and orders his execution, partly because of his inexcusable action of attacking Kumogakure. For his help during the Fourth Shinobi World War and the good word of the Sixth Hokage, Sasuke is ultimately pardoned for his crimes. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, there are an increase of Missing-nin activities across the continent due to shinobi leaving their villages since they viewed their way of life as being threatened or other reasons. In this era, they have also become far more ruthless, even willing to kill the person who hired them if there is a chance for a greater payout." .

It is also a title given to someone because of their renowned power, wisdom, or holy standing. Senjutsu are a specialised field of jutsu that involve the use of natural energy. Senjutsu practitioners, known as sages, learn to draw natural energy inside their bodies, blending it with their own chakra to create senjutsu chakra (senjutsu chakura). This chakra adds a new dimension of power to the user's techniques, while also allowing for the use of techniques that would not otherwise be possible. Senjutsu is taught by the toads of Mount Myōboku and the snakes of Ryūchi Cave. Whereas use of senjutsu is somewhat common amongst the animals that reside in these locations, very few humans have learned to perform senjutsu due to steep prerequisites and the inherent dangers of it." .

               :name "Jinchūriki" ;
               :description "Jinchūriki are humans that have tailed beasts sealed within them. They exhibit extraordinary powers due to the immense chakra reserves they possess. A millennium ago, the world was terrorised by a rampaging, colossal monster known as the Ten-Tails. Eventually, through the combined efforts of the twin brothers, Hagoromo and Hamura Ōtsutsuki, the Ten-Tails was defeated and sealed within Hagoromo, becoming its jinchūriki. Throughout his travels, Hagoromo used the Ten-Tails' power to perform many great deeds and promote peace during his lifetime, causing him to be revered as the \"Sage of Six Paths\". Towards the end of his life, Hagoromo, knowing the Ten-Tails would be unleashed on the world again when he died, split its chakra into nine living entities called the tailed beasts. Although humanity would for centuries exploit the tailed beasts as sources of power, it would not be until after the establishment of the hidden villages that the practice of creating jinchūriki resumed. The new hidden villages, each with their own tailed beasts, started sealing the beasts into selected villagers: in Konohagakure this was done to protect the village from its beast, the Nine-Tails; in Sunagakure, the abilities that manifested in their jinchūriki were studied so that non-jinchūriki could replicate them; more often than not, though, the jinchūriki were meant to be nothing more than military potential, with little regard for the jinchūriki or even the tailed beast. Because of the difficulties involved when learning to control a tailed beast and the history the tailed beast itself may have with a village, jinchūriki are often hated and ostracised by their fellow villagers, treated as no different than the beast they contain. Members of Akatsuki report that villages are often glad to be rid of their jinchūriki. However, because a jinchūriki is so valuable an asset, it is not in the village's interest to let them be captured or turn into missing-nin. To strengthen the jinchūriki's bond with the village, it is tradition for them to be related to their village's Kage: for example, Killer B is the brother of the Fourth Raikage and Gaara is the son of the Fourth Kazekage. While many jinchūriki do indeed experience hardship in their early lives, either being mistreated by the majority of the village or dying in their failed attempts to control their tailed beasts, some are able to earn respect and recognition both within their village and in the wider world: Gaara and Yagura Karatachi becomes their villages' Kage, while Killer B, Yugito Nii, and Naruto Uzumaki become regarded as heroes and icons of their villages, with Naruto also becoming a Kage eventually. Fifteen years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto and Killer B were the only two jinchūriki. Jinchūriki typically have their tailed beasts sealed into them early in their lives - often shortly after birth - so that they can grow up acclimating to their beast. Which seal is used differs from village to village, with Konoha using the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style and Kumo using the Iron Armour Seal. In order for a jinchūriki to be successful in the long term, it is important for the jinchūriki to have special compatibility or simply unique chakra that can improve their chances. If a jinchūriki has been one for a long time, their chakra will naturally adapt to their tailed beast for better compatibility. In the case of the Ten-Tails, it is also necessary that its jinchūriki have a living body. There are several ways in which a tailed beast can be removed from its jinchūriki. If the jinchūriki loses control of the beast or if the seal is simply allowed to weaken enough, the beast will be released. For female jinchūriki, seals are at their weakest during childbirth, due to the nurturing of the child in the womb taking precedence over the reinforcement of the seal. As such, another ninja is required to keep the seal intact during childbirth and restore it to full power afterwards. Akatsuki uses the Sealing Technique: Phantom Dragons Nine Consuming Seals to extract the tailed beasts and seal them within the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path for future use. Typically, the removal of a tailed beast will cause immediate death for a jinchūriki. Two jinchūriki from the Uzumaki clan, however, have been shown to survive the initial removal of their tailed beast, but they are left severely weakened and would eventually die. If a jinchūriki is able to hold on to or receive some of their beast's chakra, that will also enable them to survive. The Ten-Tails' jinchūriki can survive its removal so long as the Demonic Statue remains within them, though they will be completely paralysed for a time. Reincarnated jinchūriki can \"survive\" their beast's removal since they are already dead, but they may lose consciousness in the process." .

As genin, the three were the students of Hiruzen Sarutobi, the Third Hokage. During their time under Hiruzen's tutelage, they all learned to use the Summoning Technique, which they perform with their left hands. Despite being a team and having accomplished great things together, the three members were always in constant disagreement with one another, which Tsunade referred to as a \"three-way deadlock\". Once they became skilled ninja able to look after themselves, Hiruzen's team was disbanded. Despite the official dissolution of their team, the three continued to work together during the Second Shinobi World War. During one battle with Hanzō of the Salamander, they were the only Konoha ninja to survive Hanzō's attacks. As a reward for this, Hanzō dubbed them \"Konoha's Legendary Sannin\", a title that would follow them for the rest of their lives and which they themselves would use with pride. However, that same battle was the last one they fought together; happening upon a group of war orphans demanding training, Orochimaru proposed to kill them in order to end their suffering. Jiraiya however, chose to remain in Ame with them. By the time he had returned to Konoha, Tsunade had abandoned the life of a ninja and departed Konoha. Orochimaru, having been caught performing unethical experiments on his fellow shinobi, deserted the village. Jiraiya failed to stop Orochimaru from leaving and later left the village himself to track his and the Akatsuki's movements. Because of their legendary skills and prowess, each of the Sannin have been considered for the position of Hokage at one time or another. Jiraiya was Hiruzen's preference for the position of Fourth Hokage, but he wasn't interested in the responsibilities. Orochimaru applied for the position, but Hiruzen did not believe Orochimaru had the village's best interests at heart and was passed over in favour of Jiraiya's student, Minato Namikaze. Hiruzen again wanted Jiraiya to become Hokage after the Fourth's death, but Jiraiya once again refused. After Hiruzen's death, the Konoha Council asked Jiraiya to assume the position once more. Jiraiya declines once again, feeling unworthy of the title for failing to save the Third or Fourth, and feeling that the Hokage's duties would cut into his \"research\" time. However, Jiraiya offered to bring Tsunade back to the village, where she became the Fifth Hokage. The three were never on good terms again following the Second Shinobi World War, and even though Jiraiya and Tsunade were frequently at odds with Orochimaru when they did meet, the three ever-remained deeply attached to each other. When rumours of Orochimaru's death reach Konoha, Jiraiya and Tsunade are saddened by the news, although relieved that he was no longer a threat. When Jiraiya once again ventured to Amegakure to investigate Pain, Tsunade bet that he would die, so that her legendary terrible luck would ensure his survival. Upon learning that Jiraiya was killed by Pain, Tsunade privately mourned for his loss. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Tsunade and Orochimaru, along with a reincarnated Hiruzen, worked together once again, with Tsunade claiming that had Orochimaru changed sooner, Jiraiya might still be alive. Orochimaru responded that anyone can change given enough time, and that it was better for Jiraiya to have died than have changed." .

Only the Land of Iron continues to use samurai, with all other countries having since opted to use shinobi. In the anime, the Land of This consisted of former samurai, what Tatewaki calls rogue samurai (rōnin). Samurai usually wear heavy, segmented plate armour that covers the shoulders, chest, stomach and lower back (anime only), upper back, lower sides, and thighs. They also wear gauntlets, shin guards, and helmets; senior officers adorn their helmets with horns. The face masks they wear have built-in radios and double as respirators to combat poison regularly used by shinobi.

               :description "Before an animal can be summoned, a prospective summoner must first form a contract with the animal and/or its species. In the case of the toads, the contract is a scroll that the summoner signs their name to using their own blood and further marks with the fingerprints of one of their hands. Orochimaru has the snakes' contract tattooed to his arms, which he smears with blood each time he wants to perform a summoning. A user can summon different species provided they have signed the respective contracts, as Sasuke Uchiha is able to summon snakes and hawks while Konohamaru Sarutobi can summon toads and monkeys. Contracts remain active even after death, allowing those revived with the Impure World Reincarnation to perform summons they established when they were alive. To actually summon an animal, users apply some of their blood to the hand they signed the contract with. Usually they bite one of their fingers to accomplish this, but blood from injuries elsewhere on their body can also be used. They press the hands' five fingers to the ground and channel chakra to the hand, summoning the animal to that location. The amount of chakra gathered in the hand determines the size and number of animals that are summoned: if too little chakra is offered, only a small, young animal will be summoned; by offering large amounts of chakra, multiple adult animals can be summoned simultaneously. Two people who have signed the same contract can pool their chakra to summon especially large animals. If an individual has access to the blood of someone who has signed an animal's contract, they can use the blood to summon the animal; the individual will need to provide their own chakra, however. Animals are typically summoned in order to lend assistance to their summoner, either by carrying out tasks or joining them in combat. Summoners will sometimes use their summons as a base for other jutsu, as with Summoning: Food Cart Destroyer Technique and Summoning: Quick Beheading Dance. But summoned animals are not actually required to do anything and may choose instead to harm their summoner; Manda routinely threatens to kill his summoners. Animals can even refuse their summoner's attempt to summon them by sending another of their species in their place. Animals are not summoned indefinitely and will return to wherever they were summoned from when they tire out and/or enough time has passed. Summoners can take advantage of this by riding along when their summon returns home, granting them a quick means of escaping an area. Having the Rinnegan allows the user to circumvent several of the Summoning Technique's normal limitations. Using the Animal Path, Rinnegan users can summon dozens of different animals (and even people) without the need for blood. It is only with the Rinnegan that the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path can be summoned, whose actions are directly controlled by the Rinnegan user. Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki – the originator of the Rinnegan – is able to summon five people and the nine tailed beasts from Kaguya's Dimensions, though he needs the chakra of seventeen dead Kage to do so." .
