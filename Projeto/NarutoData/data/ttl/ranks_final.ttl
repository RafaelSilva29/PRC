               :description "Academy students (Akademī-sei) make up the student body of the Academy, where they are trained and prepared for life as a shinobi. They are not an actual part of the shinobi force, as they are still in the process of mastering the very basics of the ninja lifestyle. However, they can be conscripted as part of the war potential in times of emergency. Academy students spend their time honing the various skills they are required to have and undergoing various tests and exams to see how they progress. Besides ordinary school subjects such as history and mathematics, they are taught the basics of ninjutsu, taijutsu, and most likely also genjutsu. This includes learning about chakra and how to control it, tactics, hand seals, they are taken through the handling of ninja weapons and tools, like shuriken and kunai, learning how to throw and wield them through target practice, and several E-rank techniques, such as the Clone Technique and the Transformation Technique. They are also trained in working both individually and in teams. Eventually they are given a graduation test to see if they are ready to try and become genin. Passing this test does not automatically grant them this title, as they need to pass a second test given by their jōnin instructor, but they do receive a forehead protector. Those who fail either of these tests are sent back to the Academy. The requirements for graduating vary from village to village. In Konohagakure, the Academy students simply have to show their proficiency in a randomly selected E-rank technique. In Kirigakure, however, the test was a life-or-death battle between graduating students at one time, a practice since changed after the not-yet-qualified Zabuza Momochi massacred an entire graduation class. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, the entire curriculum has been completely revamped, to ensure all students are more prepared in every way. General studies are now offered as courses in lieu of shinobi training; also, even aspiring shinobi must pass general studies in order to graduate, as opposed to simply mastering ninjutsu. Also, techniques that were once reserved for post-graduates are now part of the courses, such as Tree Climbing and Water Surface Walking Practices and even Nature Transformation." .

               :name "Genin" ;
               :description "Genin are the lowest level of ninja and also the ones that display the most difference in power. When they become genin, ninja start to do their bit for their village's economy – being sent on missions that the village gets paid for. They are typically sent either on D-rank missions, which are almost entirely risk-free jobs of manual labour, or, rarely, on C-rank missions, which are a cut above that and begin to verge on real \"ninja\" work that have a very low possibility of risk to the ninja involved. When Konohagakure was short-handed on upper-level ninja because of the invasion, the village had to occasionally send genin on higher-ranked missions. Genin are put in four-man cells, or squad, consisting of three genin and a jōnin-sensei, in order to learn teamwork and experience true ninja life under the supervision and protection of an elite shinobi. The make-up of these teams is based on the individual skills of the genin, so that there will be a balance between the teams. For instance, Naruto Uzumaki, who passed with the lowest grades, was put in a team with Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, who passed with the highest grades and highest written exam scores, respectively. Due to the fact that genin are the lowest level ninja, they are normally assigned D-rank or C-rank missions so as to gain experience before taking on harder missions or being promoted to the rank of chūnin, by successfully completing the Chūnin Exams, a set of difficult tasks made to test the skills of genin to see whether or not they are fit to become chūnin." .

               :description "Chūnin are ninja who have reached a level of maturity and ability that primarily consists of leadership skills and tactical prowess. Chūnin are typically sent on C-rank or B-rank missions. Some chūnin, such as Iruka Umino and Shino Aburame, move on to become Academy teachers. To become a chūnin, genin participate in a large examination, known as the Chūnin Exams. Those who pass the test and become chūnin are eligible to wear an identifying flak jacket that holds ninjutsu scrolls. This vest is not mandatory; instead, some opt for more elaborate clothing like capes and robes. As a result of the peaceful era that the Five Great Shinobi Countries established after the Fourth Shinobi World War, the number of chūnin has decreased." .

               :description "Tokubetsu Jōnin are ninja who, rather than having all-around jōnin skills, only excel in a specific area, much like warrant officers in real-world militaries. For example, Ibiki Morino can completely understand the workings of the human mind, making him an expert in interrogation. They nevertheless possess enough skill overall, as they have been known to given the same opportunity as jōnin in leading their own genin teams." .

               :description "Jōnin are generally highly experienced and highly skilled shinobi who serve as military captains. Jōnin are generally able to use at least two types of elemental chakra. It is not unusual for jōnin to go on missions alone. They are often sent on A-rank missions, and if experienced enough, S-rank missions as well (which are considered to be the greatest difficulty). To become a jōnin, one may be recommended. If enough villagers and the respective Kage deem the shinobi to be fitting to the rank, they will be promoted. In the anime, another way to become a jōnin is to participate in the Jōnin Exam. When a ninja becomes a jōnin, they may be assigned to supervise a three-man genin team. Their duty will be to instruct and train them to become competent ninja. They also can decide when the genin are ready to participate in the Chūnin Exams. In Konohagakure, it is up to the jōnin to decide whether a candidate Hokage would be given the position permanently. They also have a special rank known as Jōnin Commander. Shinobi who have jōnin-level skills in only a specialised area are classified as Tokubetsu Jōnin." .

A Kage oversees the activities of their village, from sending ninja on missions to making the hard decisions regarding the safety of their people. A village's Kage is generally acknowledged as its most powerful ninja. The Kage are renowned as the top shinobi of the continent. The title was originally created by Hashirama Senju soon after the formation of Konohagakure, making him the first Kage to exist after being elected by the population of his village and country. After the creation of the position, other nations praised the innovative system that had been created and soon began to imitate." .
