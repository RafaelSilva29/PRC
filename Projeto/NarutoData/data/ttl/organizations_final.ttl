               :overview "Akatsuki (Literally meaning: \"Dawn\" or \"Daybreak\") was a group of shinobi that existed outside the usual system of hidden villages. Over the course of several decades, Akatsuki took different forms and was led by different individuals. Though each iteration is viewed as either subversives or criminals, all seek to make the world a better place through their own means. Each Akatsuki tends to have multiple lairs across the world, inaccessible either due to their remoteness or the various security measures that protect them." ;
               :history "The initial concept of Akatsuki was devised by Black Zetsu as part of its plan to revive its mother, though it pretended the idea came from Madara Uchiha. Akatsuki was originally founded by Yahiko during the Third Shinobi World War alongside his childhood friends, Nagato and Konan. As citizens of Amegakure who had been orphaned by the Second Shinobi World War, the three created Akatsuki as a way to bring peace to their home country, which too often got caught in the crossfire of the Five Great Shinobi Countries' many conflicts. In time, the three were approached by Tobi, who introduced himself as Madara Uchiha. Tobi claimed Nagato was the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Paths and offered to teach him to control the power of his Rinnegan, though Yahiko distrusted him and prompted Nagato to turn down his offer. Nevertheless, Tobi would later claim that it was he who encouraged Yahiko to form Akatsuki, unbeknownst to Konan. Akatsuki's desire for an end to war attracted many fellow Ame ninja to their cause and, in time, word of their exploits began to travel beyond Amegakure's borders. Akatsuki's early fame was owed largely to Yahiko's leadership and his natural charisma, which kept the group united and motivated them to persevere despite the difficulties of their goal. Yahiko, however, viewed himself as merely a facilitator for Nagato, who would ultimately be the actual source of world peace because of his Rinnegan. Ame's leader, Hanzō, also became aware of Akatsuki and perceived them as a threat to his rule, a belief encouraged by Danzō Shimura in the anime. Hanzō approached Akatsuki offering to help them broker peace between Konohagakure, Iwagakure, and Sunagakure. When Yahiko, Nagato, and Konan arrived to meet with him, however, they were ambushed by Hanzō's men and members of Danzō's Root, who took Konan hostage and forced Yahiko to commit suicide in order to save her. Enraged by Yahiko's death, Nagato summoned the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path and used it to slaughter their attackers, though Hanzō himself escaped. In the anime, the other members of Akatsuki were tipped off to Hanzō's plan and attempted to provide backup to Yahiko and the others. Tobi and Zetsu intercepted them and after a long battle, Tobi killed the remaining members of the group. With Yahiko's dying breath he entrusted the pursuit of peace to Nagato. Nagato, grieved by Yahiko's death, came to believe that the world would never willingly consent to peace and that Akatsuki's previously pacifist approaches were therefore futile. He concluded that the only way the world would turn away from its constant warfare would be to experience such catastrophic death and destruction that it could never again stomach the idea of conflict. Intending to be the one to show these horrors to the world, Nagato began using the alias \"Pain\" and formed the Six Paths of Pain, into which he integrated Yahiko's corpse so that he could symbolically continue leading Akatsuki. Nagato sought out Obito, under the guise of Madara Uchiha, and accepted his earlier offer of support, which he provided in secret. After the Third Shinobi World War, Akatsuki began recruiting S-rank missing-nin, its members' competing personalities and aspirations unified behind Nagato's claimed objective of world domination; this may involve a certain level of force, as Deidara experienced. Once Akatsuki recruited its target of ten members, Akatsuki began following a three-step process to achieve this stated objective: Obtain enough money to support their organisation; Provide mercenary services at well under the competitive rate, using the money gathered in the first step to offset costs. This will make countries increasingly dependent on Akatsuki's services, corner the entire market for shinobi missions, and eventually put all of the shinobi villages out of business because they can't compete with Akatsuki's prices. By capturing and strategically deploying the tailed beasts, Akatsuki could quickly start and then quell wars, thereby speeding up the process; Once all other major shinobi forces have dissolved, Akatsuki will be able to quickly conquer all the countries of the world. The early years of Nagato's Akatsuki were very successful, as the hidden villages increasingly hired Akatsuki to fight in wars and perform assassinations that the villages themselves were unwilling to get involved in during times of peace. The Fourth Raikage claims that only Kumogakure never hired Akatsuki, while the Third Tsuchikage in particular became a frequent employer. Despite being such a popular and successful group, Akatsuki was largely a mystery to those outside the organisation, with many (incorrectly) coming to believe they operated out of Kirigakure. Akatsuki experienced some turmoil amongst its members over the years: Kakuzu regularly killed his partners in fits of rage and stole their hearts for his Earth Grudge Fear; only being teamed with the immortal Hidan prevented him from continuing to do this. Orochimaru attempted to steal Itachi Uchiha's body after the latter joined the organisation, and when that failed he was forced to defect. Despite this, Akatsuki was able to begin working towards capturing the tailed beasts. Nagato's actual objective behind acquiring the tailed beasts was to harness the tailed beasts' chakra to create a powerful kinjutsu, using it to wipe out one side in a conflict and, from the display, frighten the other side and the world at large to stop the fighting. If and when the fears abated and conflicts renewed, the kinjutsu would be deployed again, creating small periods of peace in an endless chain of hatred. Because all but one of the tailed beasts were in the possession of the hidden villages, their capture risked antagonising many of Akatsuki's former clients. Despite this, Deidara claims that the previous owners of the first two tailed beasts captured by Akatsuki (indicated in the anime to have been the Five-Tails and the Seven-Tails) were glad to be rid of them. Akatsuki's mission to capture the tailed beasts gradually elevates them from the shadows of the world and, in turn, prompts a growing resistance by the hidden villages. After Deidara captures the One-Tail, Sasori is killed in battle with the Suna and Konoha forces sent to rescue the One-Tail's jinchūriki. Obito takes this open position as an opportunity to officially join Akatsuki as \"Tobi\", helping capture the Three-Tails. Around the same time, Hidan and Kakuzu capture the Two-Tails, but both are subsequently defeated in unrelated confrontations with Konoha's Nijū Shōtai. Kisame Hoshigaki later acquires the Four-Tails, after which both Deidara and Itachi separately die in battle against Sasuke Uchiha. Because of their shrinking numbers, Tobi pressures Nagato into taking a more active role in capturing the remaining tailed beasts. In the anime, he and Konan are first sent to capture the Six-Tails, which was captured at some earlier point in the manga. They are afterwards sent to Konoha to capture the Nine-Tails, and in the course of the resultant Pain's Assault the village is destroyed. When he finally locates and meets with the Nine-Tails' jinchūriki, Naruto Uzumaki, Nagato begins to doubt the direction he has taken Akatsuki in since Yahiko's death. After Nagato's Six Paths of Pain are defeated, Naruto convinces him that a bloodless peace is worth pursuing no matter how impossible it may seem. To make up for all the missteps he took, Nagato gives his life to revive the Konoha villagers that died during his attack, using his last breath to encourage Naruto to achieve the peace that he was never able to. With Yahiko and Nagato gone, Konan opts to leave Akatsuki. Tobi approached Akatsuki in order to get close to Nagato, whose Rinnegan he needed to complete the Eye of the Moon Plan. Over the years, he remained in the shadows, allowing Nagato to appear to the world as Akatsuki's leader while Obito manipulated him towards his desired ends, specifically capturing all nine tailed beasts so that he can restore the Ten-Tails and use it to cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi on the world, ending all conflict by trapping everyone in a dream. Obito follows the Eye of the Moon Plan under instructions of the real Madara Uchiha, whose identity Obito assumed after Madara's death. Madara intended Obito to have Nagato revive him in the final stages of the plan, though Obito had no plans to uphold that end of the plan and intended to use Nagato to revive himself should anything happen to him. However, this subterfuge was rendered moot by Nagato betraying Obito and using the Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique to revive everyone he killed during his invasion of Konoha. Even before Nagato's death, Obito takes a growing role in Akatsuki's activities, due in large part to Itachi Uchiha's death. He reveals himself to Kisame, who worked with him during their time in Kirigakure and is happy to collaborate with him yet again. He also convinces Sasuke Uchiha and his team, Taka, to join forces with Akatsuki, an alliance that Obito believes is worth the losses of all the other Akatsuki members. While Nagato goes after the Nine-Tails, Obito sends Taka after the Eight-Tails, the only other remaining tailed beast. Although Taka initially appears successful, they are discovered to have been tricked by the Eight-Tails' jinchūriki, Killer B. When Zetsu shortly afterwards reports Nagato's own death, Obito is deeply agitated by the setbacks, particularity Nagato's betrayal, and increasingly irritated by Naruto's constant thwarting of his plans. With their ranks so diminished and with the Five Great Shinobi Countries finally starting to mobilise against Akatsuki, both because of the attack on Konoha and the botched capture of Killer B, Obito is forced to start taking drastic actions. He first sends Kisame to capture B and then sends Taka to attack the Five Kage Summit. Sasuke does not perform as well against the Five Kage as Obito wished, as he had hoped they would be weakened enough to be forced to negotiate. Instead, he must approach them diplomatically, asking that they help him complete his Eye of the Moon Plan by surrendering the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails. They refuse, prompting Obito to initiate the Fourth Shinobi World War. While preparing for war, Obito is approached by Kabuto Yakushi, a former subordinate of Sasori and Orochimaru. Kabuto offers to bolster Akatsuki's fighting strength with the Impure World Reincarnation, reviving Akatsuki's past members and several other once-notable shinobi. Obito is reluctant until Kabuto blackmails him by reviving the real Madara Uchiha, on whose name Obito has been banking the credibility of his threats against the hidden villages. Obito is forced to agree. He then goes to Amegakure to take Nagato's Rinnegan, killing Konan in the process. News eventually reaches them of Kisame's death, but Kisame is at least able to send them intel that enables Kabuto to strengthen Obito's White Zetsu Army. In the two days of the war between Akatsuki and the Allied Shinobi Forces, both sides suffer heavy casualties, yet Naruto and Killer B elude capture. When most of the White Zetsu are defeated and Kabuto is made to end the Impure World Reincarnation, Obito, having no more options, prematurely revives the Ten-Tails. Madara, having escaped Kabuto's influence, lends a degree of support, eventually leading Obito to become the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki. He is defeated by Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke (who has since sided against Akatsuki) before he can perform the Infinite Tsukuyomi, and as a result Obito stops pursuing the Eye of the Moon Plan. With Obito's surrender, Akatsuki's schemes officially end. Following his defeat, Obito undergoes a change of heart, thanks to both Naruto and Kakashi's influence, and Obito attempts to redeem himself by using the Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique to revive everyone he killed during the war. However, his attempts are foiled by Black Zetsu, who latched itself onto Obito and forces him to indeed utilise the technique, but instead of reviving those killed during the war, Black Zetsu successfully forces Obito to fully revive Madara. Madara's plans are momentarily set back, however, as his Rinnegan eyes start to crumble away (due to his original eyes being elsewhere; his left eye being in Obito's possession, and his right eye being hidden away by Obito himself) as his reincarnated eyes were merely part of his reincarnated body. Nevertheless, Madara quickly regains possession of his right eye, and successfully perseveres, sealing the Ten-Tails into his body. Afterwards, Madara engages in battle against Might Guy, who received a boost in power from opening the Eight Gates Released Formation, whom Madara barely manages to survive against. Madara subsequently battles against both Naruto and Sasuke, who gained Six Paths Senjutsu and Rinnegan, respectively, from Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, during which Madara regains possession of his left eye from Obito. With both eyes returned, Madara subsequently awakens the Rinne Sharingan and successfully launches the Infinite Tsukuyomi. However, he is afterwards betrayed by Black Zetsu, who has been scheming for centuries to revive Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, with first Madara, then Obito, and then Akatsuki itself being mere pawns used in pursuit of that goal. Kaguya is restored using Madara as a medium but, with Obito's and Team 7's efforts, she and Black Zetsu are defeated by Naruto and Sasuke, after which Madara succumbs to having the Tailed Beasts extracted, and the Infinite Tsukuyomi is ended by the combined efforts of Naruto and Sasuke." .

               :overview "Root (Ne) was a branch of Konohagakure's Anbu training subdivision. It was disbanded after the death of its founder, Danzō Shimura." ;
               :history "Root carried out missions that Danzō believed would benefit Konoha. Because of its core views as \"the unseen ones who support the great tree of Konoha from the depths of the earth\", some of these missions were less than respectable, such as eliminating individuals that were considered potential threats simply for expressing their detestation for Konoha, despite not actually having done anything against the village. The organisation's top priority was its secrecy, and most of its missions were carried out in the dark - autonomous of Konoha's authority. Root was officially disbanded after the Uchiha Clan Downfall due to Danzō spearheading the tragedy, but remained active as an underground organisation until Danzō's death. Despite Hiruzen's orders to disband the group, the members remained loyal to Danzō, his orders being the highest priority over even the Hokage's. It was unknown what would become of Root, but Sai suggested its members look to Kakashi Hatake for guidance since Kakashi, at the time, was slated to become Hokage. Root was an extremely strict, and secretive group and as such each member of the organisation had a cursed seal imprinted on the back of their tongues by Danzō, which when activated, would paralyse their entire body if they tried to speak anything about Danzō or the organisation, rendering them unable to speak or move. Sai noted that this was done in an effort to prevent information leak should any of them be captured and interrogated by enemy forces. The seal disappeared after Danzō's death. Danzō had also trained its members to lose their emotions by growing up as brothers from a young age, only to later be made to kill each other. This was done to kill any sense of sentiment or emotional attachment. This method was extremely similar, if not identical, to the Kirigakure Academy's former graduation test. Each member had a codename; even the members themselves apparently did not know their original names. Unlike normal Anbu, they carried a tip-less tantō instead of a katana. Also unlike normal Anbu, members of Root took orders only from Danzō instead of the Kage, unless ordered to otherwise. Another speciality of the organisation was slow, long-term brainwashing. In the case of one of their members, Nonō Yakushi, she was brainwashed through a series of photographs starting with photographs of Kabuto — one of her former wards at orphanage showing him growing up. Eventually, Root slowly switched the person in the photographs entirely and then gave Nonō the order to kill the actual Kabuto. This resulted in Nonō not recognising the young man in their final confrontation. Though the members wore the standard cloak and mask of the Konohagakure Anbu, they didn't have an actual standardised uniform like the others. Underneath the cloak each Root member wore a personal attire. The only single distinguishing garment they all wore was a short, black, midriff jacket, with red straps over the shoulders along with the tip-less tantō. In the anime, despite the harsh training of Root, Danzō had never trained any member himself apart from Yamato, something which greatly shocked the other members when he announced it." .

Because of the deceitful actions of the Sixth Hokage Candidate Danzō Shimura, the other Kage asked Kakashi Hatake about Konohagakure's entrance into the alliance as they deemed him the most suitable candidate to assume the office. However, before Kakashi was made Hokage, Tsunade woke up from her coma, and resumed her post. After the summit, the five daimyō agreed to give power to their Hidden Villages, making the Shinobi Allied Forces official. The coalition was formed after Tobi's declaration of war after the five Kage and the head of the Land of Iron, Mifune, unanimously refused to hand over Killer B and Naruto Uzumaki, the jinchūriki of the Eight-Tails and the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox respectively at the Kage Summit. When Tobi departed, the Kage and Mifune discussed their plans on dealing with Tobi and the tailed beasts and later Mifune suggested that the Fourth Raikage be the Supreme Leader (Taiken) of the alliance to which the other Kage agreed. The coalition's primary objective was to defend the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails' jinchūriki from Akatsuki. The two jinchūriki, once caught, will complete Tobi's Eye of the Moon Plan. Therefore, the coalition planned to first find the two jinchūriki before Akatsuki finds them and keep them safe and away from the battlefield if necessary. Beyond that, their duty is to put up a united front against Akatsuki's army. At the suggestion of the Fifth Mizukage, the five Kage agreed to merge their intelligence unit into a single, separate organisation, to optimise the processing and sharing of new information. This is a significant development with even the Third Tsuchikage agreeing without hesitation, despite his past prejudices and the potential damage such an organisation could cause for his own intelligence forces if they should win the war; which demonstrates how significantly they are treating Tobi as a threat. To show their unification, Mifune has designed a forehead protector with the kanji \"Shinobi\" on it. All members of the alliance wear this in place of their original forehead protectors, to show that everyone is truly united under one banner, as opposed to being separated into five different villages. Most members of the alliance also took to wearing the basic uniform of their village, albeit with the new forehead protector to unify them. The first internal dissent came from the Fifth Hokage who originally strongly disagreed with the other leaders' decision for the jinchūriki were to be hidden instead of being their main forces of war, and due to her past defence of Naruto, she probably only relented due to the need for a united front. As the forces gathered, there was some tension between the ninja of different villages that led to arguments and conflict due to past experiences, until Gaara made his speech that got them to cooperate more willingly. Externally, the Water Daimyō expressed extreme reluctance to agreeing to this alliance since it would give the shinobi even greater power, despite its necessity to stand up to Akatsuki's terrorism. Later on, when Naruto Uzumaki and Killer B escaped from confinement to participate in the war, A decided it was best to kill Naruto for not submitting to his orders. Because A's decision was not sanctioned by the rest of the Kage and the high losses on the Allied Forces side, Tsunade decides to confront A and allow Naruto's involvement. After a long fight, A admits defeat to Naruto and allows him and B to pass. In the aftermath of the Fourth Shinobi World War, all five great nations and the Land of Iron had suffered crippling losses of personnel, with Kumogakure being nearly completely destroyed by the Ten-Tails' Tailed Beast Ball which had wiped out the Allied Headquarters which was located near the village. To recover from these losses, the Allied Shinobi Forces transitioned into the Shinobi Union which sped the recovery efforts up as well as opened the door for smaller shinobi villages, such as Amegakure or Kusagakure to join as equal members, eliminating the need of war for resources. The first true test for the Union was Toneri Ōtsutsuki's attempt to destroy humanity by using the Tenseigan to crash the Moon into the earth, sending barrages of asteroids and meteorites crashing to Earth. Due to the Shinobi Union's unity and resources, it was able to fend off these attacks while letting the Hanabi Rescue Team, which was led by the Union's leader Shikamaru Nara as well as the War's hero Naruto Uzumaki, to confront Toneri and defeat him. Due to these efforts, the Earth was saved and the Union had survived the test now stronger than before. Several years after Toneri's attempt, the Union's success had caused a technological revolution with modern laptops being created and used for everyday tasks, as well as cities growing around the Shinobi Villages such as Konohagakure due to prosperity. Naruto Uzumaki, the Seventh Hokage, could also meet with the Kage of the Five Great Countries within Konoha without any neutral location, showing a new era of trust between shinobi. The next test for the Union to come is the threat in the forms of Momoshiki and Kinshiki, two beings that have the Byakugan and the Rinnegan." .

               :overview "The Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist (Kiri no Shinobigatana Shichinin Shū) was an organisation consisting of only the greatest blade-wielding shinobi of their generation that Kirigakure can produce. There can only be seven members at a time — hence the name. The swords of the Seven Swordsmen are passed down from generation to generation since the First Mizukage's era, and are considered mystical. Together, the Seven Swordsmen are capable of bringing down an entire nation, and are regarded as being the strongest shinobi in the village behind the Mizukage." ;
               :history "Some time after the Third Shinobi World War, the Seven Swordsmen of the time (Fuguki Suikazan, Jinin Akebino, Kushimaru Kuriarare, Raiga Kurosuki, Jūzō Biwa, and two others) cornered a Konoha team. The team was rescued by Might Duy, who fought all seven using the Eight Gates Released Formation. In the manga, it is only known that Fuguki survived, while in the anime, only Jūzō and Raiga survived along with him. The group's make-up changed over the following years: Mangetsu Hōzuki joined and mastered all seven swords, and Fuguki was killed and replaced by his subordinate, Kisame Hoshigaki. The group's remaining members started dying — as in the case of Mangetsu — or becoming missing-nin and taking their swords with them — as in the cases of Kisame and Zabuza Momochi, as well as Jūzō and Raiga in the anime. By the time of the Fourth Shinobi World War, only Hiramekarei wielded by Chōjūrō remained in Kirigakure's possession. The \"strongest\" generation of the Seven Swordsmen was later reincarnated to fight for Akatsuki during the Fourth Shinobi World War. Five of the swordsmen were reunited with their former swords, which they used in battle against the Third Division of the Allied Shinobi Forces. Although the Third Division suffered numerous casualties, they were able to seal all of the Seven Swordsmen by the second day of the war. With the release of the Impure World Reincarnation, the sealed swordsmen's souls were ultimately returned to the Pure Land. In the anime, the remaining six swords returned to Kiri's possession, including Kubikiribōchō from Kakashi Hatake, Samehada taken by Killer B, and Kiba that was in the possession of Omoi. As such, the unit had been reinstated, with Chōjūrō personally choosing Kagura Karatachi to replace his position. Shizuma Hoshigaki later forms his own version of the group called the New Seven Ninja Swordsmen, comprised of malcontents who wish to return the village to its roots as the \"Village of Bloody Mist\". Recruiting Kagura to their cause, they take advantage of his access to the armoury where the seven blades are stored and steal them with plans of staging out a coup d'etat. However, they failed to start their revolution due to the actions of Boruto Uzumaki, his friends, Chōjūrō and eventually Kagura himself, which resulted in them being defeated and taken into custody." .

               :history "At some point during the Sixth Mizukage's era, Shizuma gained support from people connected to the Water Daimyō to start a revolution in Kiri. Upon Kagura obtaining the key to the vault containing the Seven Mist Blades, the group confronts Kagura at the Kirigakure Academy. There, Shizuma manipulates Kagura into joining his group and uses the key to get into the vault. With each member taking up a weapon, they intend to start their revolution by destroying Kiri's Memorial Park, but are stopped by Boruto Uzumaki, who is accompanied by Sarada Uchiha and Chōjūrō. Ultimately, the rogue group was defeated and their rebellion stopped before it could actually begin, being written off as \"just a scuffle among kids\". Afterwards, the group's original members were imprisoned in a correction center to undergo rehabilitation." .

               :overview "The Konoha Military Police Force is — as the name suggests — the judicial organisation of Konohagakure. Initially believed to have been founded by the Uchiha, in actuality, it was founded by the Second Hokage, and was given to the Uchiha as a sign of trust and good faith between the Senju and themselves. Tobi believed, however, that this was just a method of ostracising them from the village: having built the prison in the organisation's building which was also located on the Uchiha's compound, as well as distancing the Uchiha from taking part in the actual governing of Konoha since the police force would require them to be neutral parties. A few members, such as Setsuna, also came to believe that this was the true motive behind the organisation, and tried to rebel as a result. Tobirama, however, dismissed this notion and stated he did this in order to keep the Uchiha's emotions in check and have the village benefit from their dedication at the same time. The force naturally consisted of mostly Uchiha clan members before their downfall because — as Itachi Uchiha put it — only strong shinobi were capable of bringing other shinobi to justice. The last known leader of this organisation was Fugaku Uchiha. It is unknown what officially happened to the organisation after Itachi himself massacred the clan. In the anime, however, it was noted by the village's leaders that in future, members should be chosen via open selection instead of sticking to a single clan. The Konoha Military Police's purpose was to maintain the law in the village, regarded as \"elite shinobi who monitor fellow shinobi\". They did not have the authority of arresting Anbu members without a warrant, as Anbu directly report to the Hokage. The symbol of the organisation was a four-point star with the crest of the Uchiha clan embedded into the centre and the attire of the police force consisted of the standard Konoha-nin attire with the symbol of the police force emblazoned on the shoulders instead of the regular Uzushiogakure symbol. At some point after the downfall of the Uchiha, the emblem of the Police Force was altered to replace the Uchiha symbol with the Konoha symbol, though the original emblem remained on the station. In the aftermath of the Fourth Shinobi World War, the Fifth and Sixth Hokage stopped the police from exposing the identities of everyone connected to Root, which ultimately lead to backlash ten years afterwards. At some point, Kōtarō Fūma became the head of the force." .

During wartime, the orphanage also helped out the Konoha shinobi acting as a medical centre where the shinobi would come for treatment. It was also revealed that once old enough, the children of this orphanage could train as Konoha shinobi." ;

After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kabuto returned to the orphanage as a caretaker, working alongside his childhood friend Urushi. By the time of the Seventh Hokage's reign, the orphanage had expanded in size — adding several more buildings to its structure. After Shin Uchiha's clones were subdued by Naruto, he decided to send them to the orphanage to stay." .
